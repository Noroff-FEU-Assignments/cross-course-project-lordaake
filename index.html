    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security
        attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>



    <p id="web-security-answer"> Ensure that your website is protected against SQL Injection attacks. A URL parameter
        can be used by an attacker to manipulate your database and gain access to your site. It is necessary to use a
        parameterized query.

        Your website should be secured with HTTPS. The HTTPS protocol allows you to send secure communications over your
        computer network and prevents intruders from accessing your information.

        XSS attacks must be protected against. A XSS attack targets users of an application or a server.
        To ensure the security of your web application, you should use an advanced security development lifecycle.

        Make sure that your email transmission ports are secure. Avoid communicating through IMAP Port 143, POP3 Port
        110, or SMTP Port 25.

        The uploading of files to your website should not be possible. All files that are uploaded to your website
        should be stored in a folder outside your website. A secure transport method should be used, such as SSH or
        SFTP. Ideally, your database should be hosted on a separate server from your web server.

        Website vulnerability scanners can be used to identify security vulnerabilities on your website. The scanner
        should be constructed by a qualified team. Update your scanner on a regular basis.</p>
